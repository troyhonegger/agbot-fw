New idea for tiller interface:

Tiller looks state currently looks roughly like this:
    -height (0-100)
    -targetHeight (0-100)
    -dh (-1,0,1)
    -until (0-65535, or None for indefinitely)


I want to be able to stop the tiller without putting it into diag mode
What if I control the tiller with a sequence of commands?
    Examples:
        "starting now, target height 10"
        "starting in 100ms, target height 90"
    Commands are added to an unordered list.
    Notifications about weeds just add two commands to this list: lower at time X and raise at time X + Y
    Target height can be "STOP" or a number between 0 and 100
        May need to add more pseudo-heights
            Examples: "UP" for always up, "DOWN" for always down, "LOWERED" for in the dirt (height may depend on height sensor),
            "RAISED" for just (barely) above the dirt (height may depend on height sensor)
        One more weird exception: we don't want the tiller to be jittering up and down if there are multiple weeds in a row.
            To that end: every incoming timer should supersede all timers that trigger after it.
            This makes the order of insertion important - you have to schedule the first command (i.e. lower), THEN the second (i.e. raise).

Sprayers: same thing, but simpler, because there's no "target height". Commands look like "ON in 400ms", "OFF in 600ms", etc
Hitch: same thing, but you don't need a command list because there are no delays and there's only one command at a time.
    Commands look like "UP", "STOP", "DOWN", "RAISED", "LOWERED", or 0-100 (and maybe not even all of those)

Throttle: I'm not sure what this should look like.
