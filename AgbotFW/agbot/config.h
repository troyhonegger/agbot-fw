/*
 * Config.h
 * There are a handful of settings that need to be stored in EEPROM so that they can be configured at runtime and persisted
 * across application instances. This header defines functions for reading and writing those values. The "getter" functions
 * can be called anytime - it is expected that the implementation will buffer the settings, so there is no data read overhead.
 * The "setter" functions, however, do have overhead and, in general, should not be called except upon request over the serial port.
