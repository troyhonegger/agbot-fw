/*
 * Sprayer.cpp
 * This module contains a set of functions to be used to interact with the sprayers on the machine. It declares a global array
 * containing all eight sprayers on the machine. It also defines diagnostic operations (to turn sprayers on or off manually)
 * as well as processing operations (to schedule spraying as weeds are encountered).
