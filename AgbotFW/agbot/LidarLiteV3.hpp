 *
 * For state machine documentation see LidarLiteV3_State_Machine.drawio
 *
 * Manages the Lidar Lite laser distance sensors, used for height sensors on the BOT.
 * The LidarLite's are controlled via the I2C bus. Control logic is split across 2 classes:
 *
 * class LidarLiteSensor controls an individual sensor once it is paired (associated with
 *   a specific I2C address and location on the BOT). LidarLiteSensor has a state machine that
 *   polls the sensor regularly for readings. The poll delay is currently set at 10ms
 *   for an update frequency of 100Hz. (See READ_DELAY in LidarLiteV3.cpp).
 * class LidarLiteBank encapsulates all the sensors, and handles pairing (associating sensors
 *   with their physical locations on the BOT, and assigning their I2C addresses). It
 *   uses the sensors' enable hardlines to select one sensor at a time, pair it, and pass it
 *   off to the corresponding LidarLiteSensor. This also allows the sensors to be power-cycled
 *   at any time: LidarLiteBank dynamically reconnects to them once they come back up.
 *
 * Call LidarLiteBank::begin() on startup. This automatically calls begin() on all LidarLiteSensor's.
 * Then call LidarLiteBank::update() to run the control logic. If a sensor is paired (i.e.
 * lidarLiteBank[i].isPaired() returns true), call lidarLiteBank[i].getHeight()
 * to grab the latest measurement.
 *
 * The Lidar Lite hardware specification itself is very well documented in the datasheet:
 * https://static.garmin.com/pumac/LIDAR_Lite_v3_Operation_Manual_and_Technical_Specifications.pdf
 *
 * WARNING: The I2C control logic is blocking I/O; this is an inherent limitation of the Wire library.
 * So, the runtime of update() is roughly proportional to the number of bytes sent over I2C.
 * Therefore, for optimal responsiveness, this implementation tries to send as little as possible over I2C,
 * and breaks large read/write operations into several cycles.
 *
 * During pairing, up to 15 bytes may be sent in one cycle, to pair a single sensor. Once paired,
 * a sensor sends at most a 5-byte message in any given cycle. Therefore, up to 25 bytes may be sent
 * by the LidarLite controller in one cycle. (15 bytes to pair one sensor, and 5 bytes each if the other
 * two perform a read at the same time).
 *
 * The LidarLite sensors support both I2C fast mode (400kHz) and standard mode (100kHz). If possible,
 * I recommend using fast mode. To set fast mode, just call Wire.setClock(400000L). The worst-case
 * runtime of LidarLiteBank::update() should be around 2ms with standard mode, or 0.5ms with fast mode.
