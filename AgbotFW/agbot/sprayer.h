/*
 * Sprayer.h
 * This header defines a set of data and functions to be used to interact with the sprayers on the machine. It defines the sprayer
 * structure, which encapsulates the state of a single sprayer, as well as a global array containing all eight sprayers on the machine.
 * It also defines diagnostic operations (to turn sprayers on or off manually) as well as processing operations (to schedule spraying
 * as weeds are encountered).
