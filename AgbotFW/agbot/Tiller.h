/*
 * Tiller.h
 * Encapsulates the data and logic necessary to interact with a tiller on the multivator in the Tiller class.
 * Handles scheduling of commands (raise, lower, stop, etc) sent to a single tiller.
 * 
 * The tiller class breaks from C++ RAII pattern, to allow for its instantiation as a global variable before main() runs.
 * Accordingly, you must call begin() on every tiller before using it.
 * 
 * tiller.update() must be called every loop iteration. Most operations are scheduled, not immediate,
 * so failing to call update() will result in the physical I/O points not being activated
 * 
 * Usage example:
 *	Tiller tiller;
 *	tiller.begin(0, &config); // requires pre-initialized configuration - see Config.h
 *	tiller.killWeed();
 *	tiller.update(); // call this repeatedly so tiller can raise when ready
