/*
 * Sprayer.hpp
 * Encapsulates the data and logic necessary to interact with a sprayer on the multivator in the agbot::Sprayer class.
 * In particular, this class implements a state machine that allows you to send it either diagnostics (on/off) or
 * processing (weed/no weed) commands, and in either case, it will coordinate the task scheduling and GPIO necessary
 * to run the sprayer.
 * 
 * The sprayer class breaks from C++ RAII pattern, since needs to be initialized as a global variable, and the initialization
 * logic for a sprayer depends on the completion of certain hardware setup that occurs in the Arduino library's main() method.
 * Accordingly, you must call begin() on every sprayer before using it.
 * 
 * It is critical to remember to call sprayer.update() every loop iteration. Few of the sprayer operations (including diagnostics)
 * directly write to the GPIO pins to control the physical sprayer; instead, they tell the sprayer class it needs to change, and
 * update() performs the change.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 *	agbot::Sprayer sprayer;
 *	sprayer.begin(0, &config); // requires pre-initialized configuration - see Config.hpp
 *	sprayer.setMode(agbot::MachineMode::Process);
 *	sprayer.scheduleSpray();
 *	sprayer.update(); // call this repeatedly so sprayer can turn on when ready
