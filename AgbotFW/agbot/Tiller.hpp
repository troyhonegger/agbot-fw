/*
 * Tiller.hpp
 * Encapsulates the data and logic necessary to interact with a tiller on the multivator in the agbot::Tiller class.
 * In particular, the class implements a state machine that allows you to send it either diagnostics (raise/lower/stop)
 * or processing (weed/no weed) commands, and in either case, it will coordinate all the task scheduling, height
 * sensing, and GPIO necessary to run the tiller.
 * 
 * The tiller class breaks from C++ RAII pattern, since needs to be initialized as a global variable, and the initialization
 * logic for a tiller depends on the completion of certain hardware setup that occurs in the Arduino library's main() method.
 * Accordingly, you must call begin() on every tiller before using it.
 * 
 * It is critically important to realize that tiller operations are scheduled, and not necessarily performed immediately.
 * When you call ANY tiller function (from scheduleLower() to setHeight() to stop()), the tiller itself does not change
 * until you call update(). This is the ONLY function that performs GPIO.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 *	agbot::Tiller tiller;
 *	tiller.begin(0, &config); // requires pre-initialized configuration - see Config.hpp
 *	tiller.setMode(agbot::MachineMode::Process);
 *	tiller.scheduleLower();
 *	tiller.update();
