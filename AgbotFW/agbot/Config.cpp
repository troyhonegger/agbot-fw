/*
 * Config.cpp
 * There are a handful of settings that need to be stored in EEPROM so that they can be configured at runtime and persisted
 * across application instances. This module implements functions for reading and writing those values. The "getter" functions
 * can be called anytime - the settings are buffered into memory so there is no data read overhead. The "setter" functions,
 * however, do have overhead and, in general, should not be called except upon request over the serial port.
