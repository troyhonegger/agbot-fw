/*
 * SerialApi.h
 * Defines a set of functions for interfacing with the Serial API to communicate with the computer.
 * Most of these functions are concerned with the state of the serial buffer, but there are some
 * helper functions (for example, for parsing integers) as well. Note that this header does NOT
 * define functions to directly process messages - this was done to keep the message processing
 * code closer to the main loop function.

// logged) when this is the state.

// A valid message is ready and should be processed and cleared from the buffer to allow for more messages.
