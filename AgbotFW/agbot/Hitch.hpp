/*
 * Hitch.hpp
 * Encapsulates the data and logic necessary to raise and lower the multivator's three-point hitch in the agbot::Hitch class.
 * Unlike the apparently similar Tiller class, Hitch has no distinct states, and no distinction between diag and processing mode.
 * This is because the hitch has no need for scheduling - it can be told to raise NOW, or to lower NOW, or to stop NOW, and it
 * will do so.
 * 
 * The hitch class breaks from C++ RAII pattern, since it needs to be initialized as a global variable, and the initialization
 * logic for a hitch depends on the completion of certain hardware setup that occurs in the Arduino library's main() method.
 * Accordingly, you must call begin() on the hitch (typically in the setup() function) before using it.
 * 
 * As of the initial implementation, it is possible that the tillers will need to be stopped while the hitch is moving,
 * to prevent drawing too much current from the alternator. In case this should be the case, the Hitch class contains
 * a needsUpdate() method. It may be checked before calling update() so that, if it returns true, the controller can
 * stop the tillers before moving the hitch.
 * 
 * It is critically important to realize that the hitch class only directly controls the physical hitch through the update()
 * function; all other methods simply instruct the update() function how to do its work.
 * 
 * Usage:
 *	Hitch hitch;
 *	hitch.begin(config);
 *	hitch.lower();
 *	if (hitch.needsUpdate()) {
 *		// Remember to stop the sprayers and tillers here!
 *		...
 * 
 *		hitch.update();
 *	}
 *	else {
 *		// Update sprayers and tillers as usual
 *		...
 *	}
